            Phillip Evans has more than 40+ years of experience in construction, carpentry, and welding. His father,
            William (Bill) Evans, was the owner of a construction company that specialized in building houses, churches,
            and businesses. Having tagged along on most of Bill's jobs, he learned the trade and has passed on these
            skills to his own sons.
