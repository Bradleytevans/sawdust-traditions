            Sawdust Traditions is a family-operated woodworking company created by Phillip and Jennifer Evans. The
            foundation of their business is to deliver quality wood products built to last a lifetime at a reasonable
            cost
            for families to enjoy. Each piece of work is entirely hand-crafted and created with the client's vision in
            mind;
            Phillip's meticulous eye and attention to detail means each item is as much a work of art as it is a piece
            of
            furniture.
